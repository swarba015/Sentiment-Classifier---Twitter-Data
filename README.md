# Sentiment-Classifier---Twitter-Data

This project is part of Python 3 Specialization offered by University of Michigan in Coursera platform . I was provided some synthetic (fake, semi-randomly generated) twitter data in a csv file named project_twitter_data.csv which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. My task was to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. I created a csv file, which contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score for each tweet. At the end, I upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets, and produced a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.
